# Module-4-Pandas-Challenge

# This repository contains a folder with the files for the pandas challenge.
# The task is to analyse the data for a city school district given the data about the schools in the district.
# The data provided contains information about the schools in the district as well as students performance for all the students in the district.

# The folder PyCitySchools contains the following files:

# PyCitySchools.ipynb  - This is the jupyter notebook file which runs the analysis.
#                        The file analyses the data in order to provide:
#                            1) A district level summary of the schools in the district including the total budget, the number of students and the district average scores for math and reading standardised tests.
#                            2) A school summary which compares the achievement at each school in the standardised tests.
#                            3) A summary of the best and worst performing schools in the district.
#                            4) A comparison of the achievement in grades 9-12 at each school.
#                            5) A comparison of the results based on school spending, school size and school type 

# In the Resources folder there are two files:
# 
# schools_complete.csv  -  This file contains the general information about the schools in the district such as the type of school, number of students, budget etc.
# students_complete.csv -  This file contains the results of the standardised tests for all the students in the district.
